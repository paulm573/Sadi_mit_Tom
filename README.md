# Introduction

We made a small Game. The idea was to create a real World which transfers flawless into a virtual one.
So we took our Lego-Tiles and built a world. Then we wrote an Applicatition to have an virtual Adventure, which can be explored.
Just clone this repo and throw it into unity.
We have an example prepaired.

## Features:
### HomeScreen:
A StartScreen which accesses the Device Camera (in unity Editor the webcam)
Functionality which creates the picture and saves it for later use.
Extra Canvas to preview the taken picture and the functionality to start over 
On Click okay it will open the next scene.
Theres an Exitbuttons as well, of course.
### Maze
On Enter the Scene the App will turn each lego-nipple into a Gameobject.
Then a Player will be spawned with which you can explore your built world, started from Lego.
Collect the Coins to gether some points. Its in your hand if you can achieve a new highscore, based on the world u built bevore :)
If you have enough, or like to start over, just press the leave button and return to the Homesceen.

In Unity you can configure the World as you like by adjusting the used Assets, changing the size of the Lego-Plate and so on.
